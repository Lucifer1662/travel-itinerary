- To get around Nikko, a network of buses connects the train stations to the main sightseeing areas. The World Heritage Meguri bus loops around the central shrines and temples.
- For the Okunikko area (Lake Chuzenji, Kegon Falls), you'll need to take a longer bus ride up the winding Irohazaka road.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Spring** (April-May): Pleasant weather and cherry blossoms.
- **Summer** (June-August): A good escape from the heat of the cities, with lush greenery and full waterfalls.

## Safety Tips
- The hiking trails in Nikko National Park are well-marked, but always be prepared with proper footwear and check the weather before you go.
- Wild monkeys can sometimes be seen in the Okunikko area. Do not feed them or get too close.

## Cultural Tips
- The shrines and temples of Nikko are active places of worship. Be respectful, follow the rules, and dress appropriately.
- Remove your shoes when entering temple buildings.

## General Tips
- Wear comfortable shoes. You will be doing a lot of walking, often on uneven stone paths and stairs.
- Many of Nikko's sights are spread out, so plan your itinerary to make the most of your time and the bus schedules.
- The area around Lake Chuzenji is at a higher elevation and can be significantly cooler than the town center, so bring an extra layer of clothing.
